- awesome sound....very pretty to see this nd the sound quality was too good I wish to take this product loved this product 😍😍😍
- I think it is such a good product not only as per the quality but also the design is quite good . I m using this product from January ... In this pandemic situation it has become the most useful and helpful . Overall the bass and the sound quality is pretty good and another thing that will give you such a sigh of relief that it will provide a wire that will help you in case of lacking charges.

- This product sound is clear and excellent bass. Obviously this is a good product valuable from money. so guys any no doubt this is a really good product.....

Technical:
- awesome sound quality. pros 7-8 hrs of battery life (including 45 mins approx call time)Awesome sound output. Bass and treble are really very clear without equaliser. With equaliser, sound wary depends on the handset sound quality.Weightless to carry and in head tooMic is good, but in traffic it is not too good (3.25/5)3.5mm Option is really important to mention. Really expecting other leading brands to implement this.ConsVery tight in ears. adjusters are ok .. this ll be very tight...Technical: 
- First of all, I want to talk about sound quality. The sound quality is best for this price segment. Bass is really punchy, mids are also good, but on high volumes, the sound cracks a bit, otherwise it is really nice. 9/10.
- The headphone have the best bass and perfect to fit and fixed the on the head.....that mi a1 provide large range of Bluetooth.....and mic working fine on Bluetooth,wire also....
- I am using this headphone since 6 months, great bass I am a songs lover and like to listen all types of song, this headphone is great for all kind of music from trance or edm to hindi old song and great battery life tooo great buy bole to Paisa Vasoooool

- Reason for 1 star : Sounds for alerts for connection, low battery, incoming calls etc. plays at 10 times of volume then the volume that we usually hear anything on headphones. These notification plays at sound level that everyone in the room will hear it. Imagine it playing when u r wearing this headphones. It's like a blast in ur ears out of nowhere. When it plays like that loud when I'm wearing it, I wish to throw it away.
- yes it is good in all aspect..except mic, i tried to talk using mic over bluetooth but other person cannot hear it clearly and also that low sound irritates them...
- negative; the mic was not clear when we drive its not audible & also when we speaking calls the sound not louder it head phones...if this s/b improved it headphones relay wonderful product....

Non-technical:
- Sound quality is good. But cannot wear it for more than 10 minutes. It's sooo uncomfortable. My ears start paining because of its small size. I feel like somebody is pressing my ears from both the sides with great force. Boat needs to improve its design.
